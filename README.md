# ReactJS.NET-with-require.js-getting-started-tutorial

This repo contains example of isomorphic react rendering on both client and server side with a help of require.js.    
P.s. it also contains a bonus example with loose dependency step, take a look at the main.js to get the idea.

## Installation
- If you don't have bower installed run `npm i -g bower`
- If you don't have grunt installed run `npm i -g grunt-cli`
- To install you need to run `npm i` in tutorial folder
- To run require.js build, you need to run `grunt`

To see optimized client code you need to point `baseUrl` in require.config to a build folder.
